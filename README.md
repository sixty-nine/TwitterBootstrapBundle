TwitterBootstrapBundle
======================

This is a quick packaging of Twitter Bootstrap version 2 (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) into a Symfony 2 bundle.

It contains:

 - jQuery v1.7.1
 - Twitter Bootstrap v2.0.0

It also contains two Twig layouts that can be extended in your project.

Clear install instructions will come later, but basically it's just like any Symfony bunlde. Enable the bundle routes if you want to try the demo.
