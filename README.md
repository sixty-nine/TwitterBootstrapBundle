TwitterBootstrapBundle
======================

This is a quick packaging of Twitter Bootstrap version 2 (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) into a Symfony 2 bundle.

It contains:

 - jQuery v1.7.1
 - Twitter Bootstrap v2.0.0

It also contains two Twig layouts that can be extended in your project.

Clear install instructions will come later, but basically it's just like any Symfony bunlde. Enable the bundle routes if you want to try the demo.



Required application (Node.js)
==============================

You need node.js with the package less installed.

You can install it on Ubuntu 12.04 (only one tested) with this command

    sudo apt-get install nodejs node-less
